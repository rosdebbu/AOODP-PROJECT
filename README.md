## ü§î Why Does This Exist?

As CSE students, we've all been there:
*   You find a solution on Stack Overflow, but it's so complex you don't understand *why* it works.
*   You're reviewing a friend's code for a project and can't follow their logic.
*   You're trying to learn a new algorithm, and the sample code feels like a foreign language.

This tool was built to solve that problem. It helps you learn faster, debug smarter, and understand code on a deeper level.
